Objective: Implement classes, exception handling, and file management.
Tasks:

    Create a class Book with:
        Attributes: title, author, price.
        A method display to print the details.
    Create a subclass EBook that:
        Adds an attribute file_size (in MB).
        Overrides display to include file size.
    Write a program that:
        Accepts details of books from the user (title, author, price, file size for eBooks).
        Saves the details to a text file.
        Reads the file and creates a list of Book and EBook objects.
    Use exception handling to:
        Handle file-related errors (e.g., file not found).
        Validate numeric inputs (e.g., price, file size).
