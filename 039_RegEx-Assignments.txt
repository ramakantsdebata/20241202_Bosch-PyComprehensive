Assignments: Methods and Objects
1. Extracting Key Information
    * Find and print the first occurrence of a valid email address.
    * Check if the subject string starts with a valid <FirstName> <LastName> format.
    * Extract and print all order IDs (e.g., ORD-45231) using re.findall.

2. Data Redaction
    * Replace all error codes (ERR-####) with [ERROR] using re.sub.
    * Anonymize the email address by hiding the domain (e.g., replace @example.com with @hidden.com).


Assignments: Metacharacters and Special sequences
3. Patterns and Matching
    * Extract all numeric values, including phone numbers, dates, and order IDs.
    * Match and print:
        * Dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
        * File names with .txt extensions.

4. Analyzing Words
    * Count the number of alphanumeric words containing underscores (_).
    * Find and print:
        * Words starting with the letter r.
        * Words ending with .pdf or .png.


Assignments: Extension Notations
5. Lookaheads and Lookbehinds
    * Extract all .txt files not starting with temp using a lookahead.
    * Find and print:
        * Currency values preceded by Total: using a lookbehind.
        * All error codes (ERR-####) followed by (Critical) using a lookahead.

6. Grouping and Validation
    * Group and print phone numbers in the format <AreaCode>-<Exchange>-<LineNumber>.
    * Validate:
        * Phone numbers that start with the area code 123.
        * Error codes followed by either (Critical) or (Ignored).
